                <p>We're a safer, more professional and ethical alternative to sites like Facebook, Preloved, Pets4Homes and Gumtree.</p>
                <p>Our platform connects potential adopters with people who need to rehome their pets, dogs and cats. This makes it easier for good people to adopt the right pet whilst maximizing the chance of pets finding their forever home.</p>
                <p>We offer a non-judgmental service to rehomers and give them full control of the process. We're also helping to reduce the number of animals going into shelters. This frees up space and resources for the pets who have been abandoned, need immediate help or specialist care.</p>

                <p>When a family adopts a pet, everything changes for the better. Thereâ€™s a connection that builds. Love fills the home. And every day after is brighter.</p>
                <p>Petco Love Adopt's purpose is to help pets in need find their forever families and spread that special breed of love to as many homes as possible.</p>
